Pure Java desktop application I made with the purpose of learning Java, improving OOP and problem-solving skills.

### Features:
- The user is greeted by a main menu, and upon pressing any key the game starts
- Simple game loop, the goal is to shoot as many asteroids while not being hit by one
- Randomly generated asteroids (octagons) with random movement

### Controls:
- **W** to accelerate in the direction the ship is facing
- **A** and **D** to change ship direction
- **Space** to fire a single bullet

Building the project can be done using Maven.
